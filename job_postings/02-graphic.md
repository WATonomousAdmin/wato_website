**What is WATOnomous?**

WATonomous is a student design team at the University of Waterloo at the forefront of design, creation, and neural training for autonomous self-driving vehicles. We are proud to have finished 2nd place in the SAE AutoDrive Challenge, an international competition to build a Level 4 autonomous vehicle in four years.

Following the competition, we continued our path towards perfect autonomy, completing research papers on various autonomous vehicle technologies including action classification, control, and environment modeling. We have a track record of submitting to prestigious research conferences like ICRA, ICVES, and ITS.

Looking ahead, we are excited to pursue more opportunities, including several research projects, the Indy Autonomous Challenge as a part of the MPRW joint team, and the EcoCAR EV Challenge, in collaboration with the UWAFT student design team.
