> **Note:** This is a fixed window application where applicants will be given priority over rolling admissions. The purpose of this application is to help streamline WATonomous's onboarding process while limiting inefficiencies with our member infrastructure.

During the expedited admissions process, we will give all applicants a fair chance at entering the team. The chances of you joining the team are purely within your control. Outside of this window, WATonomous will consider applicants based on the qualifications below.

**This current expedited admissions window will be from September 3, 2025 to 11:59pm EST on September 12, 2025.** If you have missed the deadline, please submit to our rolling admission.

## Description

WATonomous is a student design team at the University of Waterloo centered around a singular mission: to show that world that bunch of students can make autonomous robots. Our team has a strong history with robotics software for autonomous vehicles, and we have since transitioned to building a multitude of different AI/Robotics projects that both support other design teams with their own Autonomy goals as well as just for the fun of it.

Currently, WATonomous is focused on the following projects:
- **Eve Autonomy:** This is our historically core initiative focusing on building an Autonomous Vehicle.
- **Micro Autonomy:** A competition-driven initiative pursuing international competitions such as F1Tenth. This team also supports other design teams with their edge-computing platforms, such as drones.
- **Rover Autonomy:** A competition-and-project driven initiative building indoor robots and mars rovers in conjunction with University of Waterloo Rover Team (UWRT).
- **Humanoid Autonomy:** A joint initiative with University of Waterloo Reality Labs building a Tele-operated Humanoid Robot.

Each project has its own flavour of Robotics, and we highly encourage members of WATonomous to switch between these initiatives to get a broader sense of perspective.

## Our Internal Structure
WATonomous has four main divisions:
- **Business Operations (BizOps) Division:** Responsible for ensuring the success of the team from a marketing, outreach, and financial standpoint.
- **Autonomous Software Division (ASD):** Our biggest division. It consists of multiple subdivisions that are each responsible for the robotics software of a WATonomous project.
- **Autonomous Platform Division (APD):** A multidisciplinary team that manages the hardware/firmware for all the robotics projects.

This application is used for admission into each division. Note that each division has their own onboarding/admissions process.

## Responsibilities
At WATonomous, you will be exposed to a plethora of opportunities that promote your career growth. We encourage members to take on a multitude of different tasks that both benefit themselves and also benefit the team's longevity.

- **Building Robots** (Mechanical Design, PCB manufacturing, Hardware Interfacing, 3D Printing, Machining, Power Management, Networking)
- **Ensuring the success of our Team** (Leadership, Graphic Design, Social Media Marketing, Planning, Website Development, Professional Communication, Sponsorship Outreach, Fundraising)

Members who can work on more than just one are HIGHLY valued.

## Key Qualifications
These qualifications depend on what you want to do in the team, but below is a non-exhaustive list of potential nice to haves:

- Experience in previous robotics competitions such as First Robotics
- Experience with Object Oriented Programming in C++, Python
- Knowledge of Inter-process Communication with tools such as ROS2
